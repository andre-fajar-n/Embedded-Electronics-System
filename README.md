### 2. ![Firmware using Assembly Language](https://github.com/andre-fajar-n/embedded-electronics-system/tree/master/assembly_language)
In this language, there are 3 projects, such as: </br>
a. Showing text in LCD 16x2</br>
b. Automatic Water Reservoir</br>
c. Control Servo</br>

### 3. ![Firmware using Bascom Language](https://github.com/andre-fajar-n/embedded-electronics-system/tree/master/bascom_language)
In this language, there are 2 projects, such as: </br>
a. Showing Counter in LCD 16x2</br>
b. Reading the tilt of device from MPU6050 and send Message to a phone number using SIM800L</br>

### 4. ![Final Project for this lecture](https://github.com/andre-fajar-n/embedded-electronics-system/tree/master/pulse_position_modulation)
The purpose of final project was sent the signal from one microcontroller to another microcontroller by **PPM (Pulse Position Modulation)** method. The number of signal that was sent is 8 signals. The **sender** used **ATMega16** and the **receiver** used **Arduino Mega** To send the signal, I used infrared LED. And to receive the signal, I used photodiode.
